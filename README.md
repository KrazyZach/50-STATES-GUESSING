# 50-STATES-GUESSING

This is my first contribution in a while, so let me explain why.

Lately, I have been so focused on school that I havn't really been able to explore my two passions. Physics / Math and Programming. 

Whoever is reading this, I'm sorry for ranting but sometimes I feel like school really just crushes my passions
I have to constantly put them aside in order to work on class work, regardlass this is no excuse.
